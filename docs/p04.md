## Extensible Files

### Data Structures Created

For this part of the project, I created 2 new data structures, block_table nad double_block_table, as well as edited the inode_disk struct. The two structures I created, block_table and double_block_table, only contain 1 attibute: blocks, each of which is an array of 128 block_sector_t types. Although they have the same field name, they both store different information. The block_table blocks attribute is meant to directly store the sector numbers that contain things like file data. However, for the double_block_table struct the blocks field is meant to store the block numbers that contain the aforementioned block_table struct. I use these two data structures in the inode_disk struct, which has been significantly modified in order to store extensible files. It still contains the original 2 fields: length and inode_magic, but contains a couple of new ones as well. It contains three new tables to store file information: direct, indirect, and double_indirect. This follows the file system structure we learned in class and also takes advantage of the fact that most files are small but big files are very large. This file structure allows me to store about 8 megabytes worth of data despite only having access to 512 bytes per sector. The next couple of fields are for storing metadata related to the inode, those being is_dir, location, and parent. Is_dir is used to determine whether the inode is a directory or a file. Location stores the block number the inode itself is stored in, and parent stores the sector number of the parent of the inode

### Algorithms Used

For extensible files, there were three main algorithms I used: calculating the appropriate table entry to store file data, allocating a new sector and storing it in the block table, and finally allocating new sectors when I reached the end of the inode when I was writing to it. Starting with the first one, because of the indirection provided by this new block table design, I needed a way to still contiguously allocate blocks, or at least make it seem like I was doing so. This is so, when writing to an inode, I can just go to the next entry in the block table, despite it being comprised of three separate data structures. To do this, I needed to come up with a function that, given an offset, I can find the appropriate table entry. To this, I first need to convert the offset, which is currently in bytes, to sectors, a simple calculation done by dividing the offset by the block sector size constant. Then, there are three cases. If my offset is less than 120, that means it is in the direct block table and I can just index into that table with the sector offset. Similarly, if I am greater than 120 but less than 120 + 128 = 258 sectors, that means I need to store this in my indirect table. However, this requires reading the block that contains this indirect table. Once I do, I can then index into the array of blocks stored in the indirect table by subtracting 120 from the current block offset. This is because the array of blocks in the indirect table is still indexed from 0 - 128. Finally, if I am greater than 256 that means I need to index into my doubly indirect block table. There are two calculations that need to be done, the correct indirect block table to access and then the correct block index to access within that inode. To access the correct indirect block table, we can think of each one as a group of 128 blocks. As such, we can floor divide the offset by 128 to see which group of 128 its in. Now that we have the indirect block table, we now need to figure out which index we need. We can take inspiration from circular buffers and use the modulus operator to find the proper index. This gives us the correct indices for both the doubly indirect table and the indirect table. This finally gives us the proper block number we requested.

The next thing we need to do is allocate blocks given an offset. I noticed that when I statically allocated an array of block_sector_t types, they were all initialized to 0. I used this information to figure out whether it was allocated or not. Thus, I use the previous algorithm I described above to first obtain the position of a partiucular table entry given an offset. However, I check if it is 0 before using it and if it is, I allocate a new block and store its number in that section, otherwise I just return the block number. 

The final thing I needed to implement was the new write function that allowed extensible files. First, I would check if I had seeked past the end of the file. If it was, then I would allocate the proper amount of sectors between the actual content of the file and the cursor and then write 0s to them. Once the file size and the offset were matching, I would start writing the data from the buf argument. There was actually very little to change in this function, all I had to do was find the proper sector to write to and the preexisting code would do the rest. To do this, I used the second algorithm I discussed previously. Another small change I had to make was incrementing the file size once the write was done. To do this, I first check if I had to expand the file by finding the difference between the length of the file and the offset. If the amount of bytes I wrote is greater than this quantity, then I can find the difference between the amount of bytes I wrote and the original difference I found to check the amount of bytes I wrote to newly allocated sectors. 

### Synchronization Techniques Used

I don't use any new synchronization techniques. However, the original lock from project 2 that covered the entire file system. However, this lock is already invoked on all syscalls that use the filesystem, and thus was not used anywhere else.

### Significant Changes made to Project 2

N/A

### Justification of Design

For this part of the project the purpose was to develop a way that can automatically extend files when needed and upgrade the contiguous allocations that the original pintos made. To start, I added a layer of indirection that now allocates blocks in different regions, but is still able to access them as if they were contiguous. Secondly, I made a function that can index into this table and provide the appropriate block number, allocating a new one if the provided offset is large enough. Thirdly, I integrated this function into the inode_write function, the only function that would need to extend a file. Thus, while there is a max file size of approximately 8 megabytes, this is significantly larger than what pintos supported previously and does not require a contiguous allocation of blocks, something that the original pintos required. 

## Subdirectories

### Data Structures Created

We’ve added new fields to the following structs to allow the functionalities of subdirectories:
inode: bool is_dir; block_sector_t parent; 
inode_disk: bool is_dir; block_sector_t parent; 
dir: bool is_dir; 
dir_entry: bool is_dir; 
The most important one is the is_dir field, which checks if a particular inode is a directory. We need to use this in our functionality for open, where we need to return a directory pointer. This is because currently, the filesys_open function returns a file pointer. In pintos, directories and files are different. However, if we make directory pointers and file pointers have the same fields, we can cast directories to files and treat them as the same. As for the parent fields, they are used in parsing relative file paths that include .. .


### Algorithms Used

For this part of the assignment, we first needed to create several new syscalls to support subdirectories. These were: mkdir, readdir, isdir, and inumber. All of these functions followed a similar format as they were simply wrappers around existing functions within pintos. For example, mkdir simply verified the arguments were valid as we did in project 2, allocated a new block, created a directory in that block, and then added it to path specified. Then, for readdir, we get the file path, and then retrieve the necessary inode by parsing the path. For isdir and inumber, we simply read the relevant attributes in the inode_disk struct.

The complex part of this assignment comes from the string parsing, where we developed 2 new functions: parse path and parse_path name. Starting with parse_path, what we do is we use the strtok_r function and split the string by the / symbol. Then, what we do is we store these into an array. After that, we iterate through the array, calling dir lookup on each one until we reach the second to last one. At this point, we have the directory the file is located in. We can then return this directory back to the filesys_open function. The way this function worked originally was it would always try to open the file in the root directory, but that is just another directory. By finding out the directory where the file is located, we can then feed the function this directory instead. Once we have this directory, we can then parse out the file name using parse_path_name, which just returns the last token of the path. By doing this, we can then get the path and the file name we are meant to open. Now that filesys_open has what it needs, we can then finally call dir_lookup one last time to obtain the file pointer. 

Another key point to mention is how we deal with relative file paths, i.e. paths that contain . and … If we find one of these, what we can do is in the for loop when we iterate through all of the tokens, we can simply open the same directory using the token before the ., and for .. we can similarly open the token 2 indices before the .. . 


### Synchronization Techniques Used

During the operation of the new syscalls (mentioned above), whenever the syscalls need to read/write to/from the file system, we would acquire a lock fs_lock initially, and release it right before the syscalls return. This is to only allow one process to access the file system at a time. 

### Significant Changes made to Project 2

We made a few changes to the old syscalls we implemented from project 2. First of all, many of the file system related functions of the old syscalls use are updated to distinguish files and directories, such as: filesys_open(), filesys_create(), and filesys_remove(). Additionally, the SYS_OPEN syscall required additional modifications. Since now there are subdirectories, files may not be in the root directory, we’ve added path parsing to open subdirectories to find the file we need to open, create, or remove. 

### Justification of Design

In this part of the assignment, there were two goals: to add more syscalls and allow syscalls that took in filepaths to support longer filepaths. Starting with the syscalls, the main goal of this was to allow user programs to call already existing functions within pintos. This is what we did, while still applying the same guards as we did in project 2. Moving on, the syscalls that take in file paths are no longer limited to 14 characters due to our string parsing algorithm. While file and directory names are still limited to 14 characters, the syscalls themselves are able to take significantly longer file paths, up to 256 characters. Our string parsing algorithm is able to extract a string that is less than 14 characters long, which is what allowed us to use the existing pintos calls. 

## Working Directories

### Data Structures Created

While I did not create any new data structures in this part of the assignment, I did modify the existing thread struct to store a pointer to a string, which contained the current working directory. 

### Algorithms Used

Firstly, what I would do is when a process was created, I would set its current working directory to "/" to represent it being in the root directory when it starts up. Then, on the chdir function, I would first do the typical argument validation that every other syscall does and then check if the directory exists and then update the current working directory string of the current thread to whatever the user fed it. Now that the current working directory has been updated, I can use it in the other syscalls to properly make directories. For example, in the open syscall what I do is I check if the current working directory is the root. If it isn't, then I preprend it to the initial argument so that it can then be properly parsed in the parse_path function I mentioned earlier. To deal with file paths involving . and .., I largely handled this in my string parsing function in the subdirectories implementation. 

### Synchronization Techniques Used

Only used the file system lock we used previously in project 2.

### Significant Changes made to Project 2

The big changes I made to my project 2 implementation were the syscalls of open, create, and remove. This is because they all took file paths as arguments, and as a result of this they needed to take into account the current working directory. To do this, I simply preprended the current working directory to the argument provided if it was not an absolute path, i.e. it didnt start with a slash. 

### Justification of Design

This is a rather simple part of the assignment, as all it requires is maintaining a string that certain syscalls can check if they are inputting a relative filepath. As such, all I need to check is if the file path is absolute: that it starts with a slash. Once that is done, I can implement additional logic in my string parsing function for directories to account for . and .. .
