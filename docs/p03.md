# Assignment 3 Design Doc

## Paging

### Data Structures Created

struct vm_entry {
  //add all fields outlined in 
  struct hash_elem hash_elem;
  void* addr;
  char permissions;
  bool in_memory;
  bool in_swap;
  bool in_file;
  size_t swap_index;
  struct file* file;
  off_t offset;
  size_t read_bytes;
  size_t zero_bytes;
  bool writable;

  //TODO: add additional information for arguments for load_segment, block r/w
};

In our design we created three new data structures: a supplemental page table, a frame table, and a swap table. The supplemental page table is a hash table consisting of vm_entry structs, which contain the fields location, the address of the supplemental page table entry, the permissions of the page, the arguetns
